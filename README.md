## Conclusion

### Why I built this project this way?

I built this project in React, in order to refamiliarise myself with the basic principles of React.

### I gained confidence...

I have gained confidence in using

- Components
- Dynamic Data
- Routing
- Styling
- Responsive design for Mobile Use
- Props

### If I had more time...

In the future, I would like to use these components to a more suitable project. As this is a charity organisation and most of the data is static, HTML and CSS alone would have been enough to form this website template. Furthermore, the components made, are not really suitable for the type of organisation. The current layout matches a modern 'app' based service. I would like to include more data with less white space.

I would also like to have populated the website with more information in the remaining routes as well as main information, including a gallery, and using Facebook's API to display the content from the social media platforms to the website. I would have also liked to integrate the donation options into the website.

I would also like to learn front-end testing, in order to make sure future builds for bigger important projects are stable and perform correctly.

IN THE NEAR FUTURE - I NEED to update the information on the Home page, insert new images, and type in some sample data.

- Update Icon
- Update Title Page
- Make Home Text Bigger
- Make the Donate button orange on hover
- Make the Home image darker
